# Machine Learning Classifying Types of Iris Flowers
# Overview
This dataset contains three types of Iris flowers, with 50 samples of each type. I built a neural network using PyTorch, leveraging NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation. The model takes four inputs—Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width—helping me gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning models are built and trained.

# Setting up the Model & Data Processing
Initializing Arguments: Setting up the input layers, # of hidden Layers, # of neurons in the hidden layer, and the output  
Loading Data and Processing: Imported the dataset from a CSV file, separated inputs (X) and outputs (y), and label-encoded the Iris flower types ('Iris-setosa' → 0.0, 'Iris-versicolor' → 1.0, 'Iris-virginica' → 2.0)
Training/Testing: Splitting the dataset randomly into training data and testing data  
Minimizaing Loss: Comparing the predicted output and real value output, initiated learning rate, Back Propagation so we can apply gradient decent and start finding the minimum  
Visualization: Graphed the Losses to see if it is decreasing

# Results
I would like to first mention when doing EDA I realized that the data for what happens to students after graduation(postsecondary) but the data is unusable. I was planning on showing which schools lead to colleges more often, or jobs more often, etc.
